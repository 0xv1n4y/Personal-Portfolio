Users can create groups, manage participants, and group admins have control over group settings. The frontend is built with React.js and styled using SCSS for a fully responsive, modern design across mobile, tablet, and desktop. To enhance performance, lazy loading is implemented to load chat messages only when needed, improving app speed and responsiveness. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, handles APIs and real-time communication, while MongoDB stores user data and chat histories. The application also incorporates JWT-based authentication for secure login and session management. Additional features include a typing indicator and optimization for smooth performance on all devices.",

The application allows users to submit, edit, view, delete, and download clinical trial applications used for regulatory and academic purposes. Large and complex clinical trial forms are divided into multiple sub-forms on the frontend, combined dynamically on the client side, and stored across multiple structured database tables. The UI features a smooth drawer-based navigation system for easy form section access and a Mantine-powered table for managing submitted applications with edit and delete functionality. The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, providing RESTful APIs for full CRUD operations. A key feature of the system is dynamic PDF generation, allowing users to download completed applications directly from the platform.
