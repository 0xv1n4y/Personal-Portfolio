Users can create groups, manage participants, and group admins have control over group settings. The frontend is built with React.js and styled using SCSS for a fully responsive, modern design across mobile, tablet, and desktop. To enhance performance, lazy loading is implemented to load chat messages only when needed, improving app speed and responsiveness. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, handles APIs and real-time communication, while MongoDB stores user data and chat histories. The application also incorporates JWT-based authentication for secure login and session management. Additional features include a typing indicator and optimization for smooth performance on all devices.",
